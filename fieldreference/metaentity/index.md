| Hide In Launcher | HideInLauncher | Bool |  |  
| Url | EntityUrl | String | Enter a Url for virtual entities to navigate to the page or action. For example, workflows you design can be launched from the App Launcher and/or main menu by creating a Virtual Entity, setting the the Workflow's url and then linking it to a new or existing app.  |

| Security Parent | SecurityParent | String | Use to specify the security parent for details entities in a header-details relationship such as order lines which can only be accessed by selecting the header entity record first.

| Feature Keys | FeatureKeys | List<string><br/>  [Picklist: FeatureKey-Multiselect] | Select the feature keys that a user requires to access this entity. A user's feature keys are determined by the subscription linked to the organization in the NetMatix Subscription Manager. If no feature keys are specified (default) here then all users with sufficient access rights will be able to view the entity. In summary, a user must have both the required subscription and the required access security rights to view an entity. |

| Help Text | HelpText | String | Use this space to provide more detailed guidance to your users. Text can be formatted using Markdown which is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax for formatting plain text.syntax. Markdown can also include hyperlinks to access additional information. The help text position and display style are governed by the Help Text Position dropdown.  |  
| Field Help Text Position | FieldHelpTextPosition | FieldHelpTextPosition | Determines where and how the text entered in the Help Text field will be displayed. See the option descriptions in the dropdown. <br/>  Allowable Values: <br/>  <br/>  **IconLink**: Displays a question mark icon beside the tooltip exclamation icon for fields on forms where help text is available. When a user clicks on the link, the help text appears in a popup window. <br/>  **TextUnder**: Displays help text under the field in a smaller font size on forms and pages. On mobile displays, this option is automatically converted to the HyperlinkUnder option. <br/>  **HyperlinkUnder**: Displays the first line of the help text as a hyperlink under the field on forms and pages. When a user clicks on the link the full help text appears in a popup window. <br/>  **HyperlinkRight**: Displays the first line of the help text as a hyperlink to the right of the field on forms and pages. When a user clicks on the link the full help text appears in a popup window. <br/>  **DoNotDisplay**: Helptext does not display. This can be overriden on individual form layouts.  |  
| Notes | EntityNotes | String<br/>  [Template: MultilineText] | Use to specify information for admin or developer use that will not normally be shown to users.  |  
| External Table Name01 | ExternalTableName01 | String | For internal use. External table names are typically used to store the table name for the same type of data in an external system to facilitate integration. They can also be used to retain original table names for converted data.  |  
| External Table Name02 | ExternalTableName02 | String |  |  
| Delete Behavior | EntityDeleteBehavior | EntityDeleteBehavior | Determines whether an entity record can be deleted when it is referenced by other entities. Normally set to Restrict to prevent deletion of Contacts and other core entity records.
